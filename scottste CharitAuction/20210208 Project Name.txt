
Issue - Project Name

	There is no better word to describe
what this app is/does than Auction. As such
i have put little thought in not including
the word. As well it should appear in plain 
english as it is the anchor for the name and
will be easier to understand.
	I do not like the vibes of Give, 
Charity, or Donation while it will mostly be 
used by charities and you could say that we 
are being charitable for making it open 
source. I think there is an air of "For 
Charity Only" that i want to avoid.
	I'll look in two directions first 
one being a more technical description of
what it is (open, free). The second, more
fun and expressive (gala, happy, cheerful).
and thier Spanish, French, Latin counterparts

Conclusion
	Pick a Latin word. Slap it next to
Auction(in english). Call it a day.
	My vote goes for AccioAuction it's
fun maybe too fun for what you want. But 
accio(summon) is a well known latin word and 
people know what it means. You could say 
organizers have a need to summon up an auction 
app as well the participants want, to summon 
to them, the item they bid on. Bid is a 
synonym for summon. And the icing on this word
shaped cake, alliteration.
